// 1. Create an array 'events' of the different game events that happened (no duplicates)

// 2. After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from minute 64 was unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.

// 3. Compute and log the following string to the console: "An event happened, on average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)

// 4. Loop over 'gameEvents' and log each element to the console, marking whether it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this: [FIRST HALF] 17: ⚽ GOAL
