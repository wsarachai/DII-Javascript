### Your tasks:

1. Re-create execrise-3, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')

2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6)

3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)

4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake' methods, and with the getter and setter.

### Test data:

- Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
